	<p> I do have interests in other fields other than studies and so do have hobbies.
		My main hobby is <strong>Language studies</strong>.
		I do know some popular European languages and like to compare them with my mother-tongue or English. 
		This is because , the way people communicate, fascinates me and most importantly it is a new way to see the world.
		Besides ,I also like literature,playing football and good fun.</p>
