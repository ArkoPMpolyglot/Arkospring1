In this project-based course, you will learn the fundamentals of sentiment analysis, and build a logistic regression model to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative.
We will use the popular IMDB data set.
Our goal is to use a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn for document classification.

This course runs on Coursera's hands-on project platform called Rhyme.
On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. 
You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops containing all of the software and data you need for the project.
Everything is already set up directly in your internet browser so you can just focus on learning.
For this project, youâ€™ll get instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and scikit-learn pre-installed.
